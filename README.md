ABC bank is a small bank in Sri Lanka to register their customers to serve them fast. The bank is planning to have an information system to maintain the details of their savings account holders.
The system must be able to facilitate opening accounts to new customers (maximum of 5 customers) and display all the customers in the bank with their account number, name and the bank balance when needed. Also, the system should have the facility to change details of the customers (except account number and the bank balance) already registered with the bank, and to deposit and withdraw money when required for a given account. The bank should also be able to view the details of a customer for a given account when required.
When the bank gets a new customer, the following details should be recorded and stored in the system.
